# Set up and Defining variables -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Install and load the the `stringr` package, which has a variety of built in functions that make working with string variables easier.
install.packages("stringr")

# Create a numeric variable `my.age` that is equal to your age
my.age <- 20

# Create a variable `my.name` that is equal to your first name
my.name <- "Sunghwan"

# Using multiplication, create a variable `minutes.in.a.day` that is equal to the number of minutes in a day
minutes.in.a.day<- 24*60

# Using multiplication, create a variable `hours.in.a.year` that is the number of hours in a year
hours.in.a.year <- 24*365

# Create a variable `more.minutes.than.hours` that is a boolean value (TRUE/FALSE)
# It should be TRUE if there are more minutes in a day than hours in a year, otherwise FALSE
more.minutes.than.hours <- minutes.in.a.day < hours.in.a.year


# Working with functions ----------------------------------------------------------

# Write a function called `MakeIntroduction` that takes in two arguments: name, and age. 
# This function should return a string value that says "Hello, my name is {name}, and I'm {age} years old".
MakeIntroduction <- function(name,age){
  sentence <- paste("Hello, my name is ",name,", and I'm ",age," years old",sep = "" )
  return(sentence)
}

# Create a variable `my.intro` by passing your variables `my.name` and `my.age` into your `MakeIntroduction` function
my.intro <- MakeIntroduction(my.name,my.age)

# Create a variable `casual.intro` by substituting "Hello, my name is ", with "Hey, I'm" in your `my.intro` variable 
casual.intro <- sub("Hello, my name is ","Hey, I'm ",my.intro)

# Create a new variable `loud.intro`, which is your `my.intro` variable in all upper-case letters
loud.intro <- toupper(my.intro)

# Create a new variable `quiet.intro`, which is your `my.intro` variable in all lower-case letters
quiet.intro <- tolower(my.intro)

# Create a new variable capitalized, which is your `my.intro` variable with each word capitalized 
# hint: use the stringr function `str_to_title`
capitalized <- str_to_title(my.intro,"1")

# Using the `str_count` function, create a variable `occurrences` that stores the # of times the letter "e" appears in `my.intro`
occurrences <- str_count(my.intro,"e")

# Write another function `Double` that takes in a variable and returns that variable times two
Double <- function(number){
  numRet <- (number*2)
  return(numRet)
}

# Using your `Double` function, create a variable `minutes.in.two.days`, which is the number of minutes in two days
minutes.in.two.days <- Double(minutes.in.a.day) #or Double(60*24)

# Write another function `ThirdPower` that takes in a value and returns that value cubed
ThirdPower <- function(number){
  thirdNum = number^3
  return(thirdNum)
}

# Create a variable `twenty.seven`` by passing the number 3 to your `ThirdPower` function
twenty.seven <- ThirdPower(3)

# Vectors ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create a vector `movies` that contains the names of six movies you like
movies <- c('Iron Man','Spider-Man','Batman','Hulk','Harry Potter','The Beauty and The Beast')

# Create a vector `top.three` that only contains the first three movies in the vector
top.three <- movies[c(1,2,3)]

# Using your vector and the paste method, create a vector `excited` that adds the phrase -
# " is a great movie!" to the end of each element in your movies vector
excited <- paste(movies,"is a great movie!")

# Create a vector `without.four` that has your first three movies, and your 5th and 6th movies.
without.four <- movies[-4]

# Create a vector `numbers` that is the numbers 700 through 999
numbers <- seq(700,999)

# Using the built in length function, create a variable `len` that is equal to the length of your vector `numbers`
len <- length(numbers)

# Using the `mean` function, create a variable `numbers.mean` that is the mean of your vector `numbers`
numbers.mean <- mean(numbers)

# Using the `median` function, create a variable `numbers.median` that is the mean of your vector `numbers`
numbers.median <- median(numbers)

# Create a vector `lower.numbers` that is the numbers 500:699
lower.numbers <- seq(500,699)

# Create a vector `all.numbers` that combines your `lower.numbers` and `numbers` vectors
all.numbers <- c(lower.numbers,numbers)

# Dates ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

# Use the `as.Date()` function to create a variable `today` that represents today's date
# You can pass in a character string of the day you wrote this, or you can get the current date
# Hint: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.3.2/topics/Sys.time
today<-Sys.Date()  # if I want to use as.Date    today<-as.Date(Sys.Date())

# Create a variable `summer.break` that represents the first day of Summer break (June 9, 2017). 
# Make sure to use the `as.Date` function again
summer.break <- as.Date("June 9, 2017",format='%B %d, %Y')

# Create a variable `days.to.break` that is how many days until break (hint: subtract the dates!)
days.to.break <- (summer.break-today)

# Define a function called `MakeBirthdayIntro` that takes in three arguments: 
# a name, an age, and a character string for an upcoming birthday.
# This method should return a character string of the format:
#  "Hello, my name is {name} and I'm {age} years old. In {N} days I'll be {new.age}" 
# You should utilize your `MakeIntroduction()` function from Part 1!
MakeBirthdayIntro <- function(name,age,bday) {
  bday <- as.Date(bday, format = '%B %d, %Y')
  dateDiff <- bday- today
  bDaySentence <- paste(MakeIntroduction(name,age), ". In ", dateDiff," days I'll be ", age+1, sep = "")
  return(bDaySentence)
}

# Create a variable `my.bday.intro` by calling your `MakeBirthdayIntro` function and passing in `my.name`, `my.age`, and your birthday.
my.bday.intro <- MakeBirthdayIntro(my.name,my.age,'September 16, 2017')

# Challenge ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Write a function `RemoveDigits` that will remove all digits (i.e., 0 through 9) from all elements in a *vector of strings*. 
RemoveDigits <- function(element) {
  return(gsub('[0-9]+', '', element))
}

# Demonstrate that your approach is successful by passing a vector of courses to your function
# For example, RemoveDigits(c("INFO 201", "CSE 142"))
courses <- RemoveDigits(c("INFO 201","INFO 101","MATH 126"))
